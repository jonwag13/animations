# animations
Here I use matplotlib to visualize both temporal and spatial changes to snow cover over the San Juan mountains located in Colorado.  Data used here was from my Master's thesis.  My goal for this personal project was to self-learn how to use matplotlibs video features to create animations, which can serve as a powerful medium to help us better grasp patterns in our datasets.

## Libraries Used
#Matplotlib #Xarray
